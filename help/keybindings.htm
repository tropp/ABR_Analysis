<P>The current waveform is displayed as a thick, black line.  Threshold waveform is specified by a dashed line.  If a negativity or positivity is selected, it will be indicated by a white square.  Negativities are indicated by triangles, positivities as squares.  Red is P1/N1, yellow is P2/N2, green is P3/N3, light blue is P4/N4, and dark blue is P5/N5.</P>
<P>The following keybindings are used when processing a waveform series:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>Up/Down arrows</STRONG> &#8211; Select previous/next waveform in the series</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>Right/Left arrows</STRONG> &#8211; Move a toggled peak left or right along the waveform.  Movement of the peak will "snap" to estimated peaks in the waveform.  To adjust the peak in fine increments, hold down the <em>shift</em> key simultaneously.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>Number keys 1-5</STRONG> &#8211; Select the corresponding peak on the current waveform.  To select N1-5, hold down <em>shift</em> while pressing the corresponding number.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>I</STRONG> &#8211; Estimates N1-5 for all waveforms.  If N1-5 is already estimated, recomputes the estimate.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>U</STRONG> &#8211; Updates guess for corresponding P or N of successive waveforms based on position of currently toggled P or N.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>N</STRONG> &#8211; Toggles normalized view of waveform.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>+/- keys</STRONG> &#8211; Increases/decreases scaling factor of waveform.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>S</STRONG> &#8211; Saves amplitude and latency of peaks.</LI>
	<LI><STRONG>Return</STRONG> &#8211; Set threshold to current waveform.</LI>
</UL>
The appropriate keys will repeat if you hold down the key, which may be useful when navigating through the waveforms or adjusting the location of a peak.
